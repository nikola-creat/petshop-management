## History
Microsoft Petshop 4.0 was released over 10 years ago as a sample application to demonstrate specific challenges from that time, like upgrading from .NET Framework 1.1 to 2.0. Since it is quite old, it is hard to find information about it. This post contains some more details  https://blog.codinghorror.com/net-pet-shop-4/ and the msi was available for download here at time of writing http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/0/1/801ff297-aea6-46b9-8e11-810df5df1032/Microsoft%20.NET%20Pet%20Shop%204.0.msi.
